/**
 * Native OS notification helpers for VPN / USB lifecycle events.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: the operator needs to know — without
 * pulling up the panel — when (a) the VPN tunnel comes up or drops,
 * and (b) a USB device finishes attaching / detaching. The panel
 * already mirrors the state, but a notification makes those events
 * non-blocking surface area: the user can be on a Slack window or in
 * a terminal and still see "Pi-shop-01: SanDisk USB attached" the
 * moment the bridge confirms it.
 *
 * Implementation notes
 * --------------------
 *   • Electron's main-process `Notification` API maps to the native
 *     toast on each platform: Action Center (Win), Notification
 *     Centre (mac), libnotify/notify-osd (Linux).
 *   • We call `Notification.isSupported()` once at module load. On a
 *     headless or notification-deprived environment the helpers
 *     no-op rather than throwing — IPC handlers should never crash
 *     because the toast couldn't render.
 *   • Title/body are bounded so a malicious or absurdly long device
 *     label can't push past the platform's display limits and break
 *     wrapping. Linux libnotify in particular has a per-line cap.
